# Learning EsLint essentials

> ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

## Install

> You can install ESLint using npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

Run below command to initialize Eslint.

```sh
npm init @eslint/config
```

> npm init @eslint/config assumes you have a package.json file already. If you don't, make sure to run npm init or yarn init beforehand.

## Confiuration

> After running npm init @eslint/config, you'll have a .eslintrc.{js,yml,json} file in your directory. In it, you'll see some rules configured like this:

```js
{
    "rules": {
        "semi": ["error", "always"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"]
    }
}
```

> Your .eslintrc.{js,yml,json} configuration file will also include the line:

```js
{
    "extends": "eslint:recommended"
}
```

> Because of this line, all of the rules marked "âœ“" on the rules page will be turned on. Alternatively, you can use configurations that others have created by searching for "eslint-config" on npmjs.com. ESLint will not lint your code unless you extend from a shared configuration or explicitly turn rules on in your configuration.
