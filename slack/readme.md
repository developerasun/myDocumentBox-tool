# Learning Slack essentials
> Welcome to Slack — a messaging app for business. Slack transforms the way organizations communicate by bringing people together to work as one unified team. To help you get started, check out the video below for a quick tour, then read on for more details.

## Guide to apps in Slack
> Apps connect other software you use (like Google Calendar, Salesforce, or one of your company's internal tools) to Slack. With all your tools in one place, you can streamline work and help people in your workspace collaborate more effectively.

### What you need to know
> There are a few different types of apps you may see in Slack — built by Slack, third parties, or your own team. How an app was built determines how it can be installed and managed in a workspace, as well as where and how you’ll be able to interact with it.

> By default, any workspace member can install apps, but owners and admins can choose to restrict this permission. Once an app is installed to a workspace, any member can connect their account to use it.

> Before installing an app from the App Directory, you can review its privacy policy and security and compliance information (if submitted by the app’s developer) from the app page. We recommend only choosing services you trust when installing apps to Slack.
