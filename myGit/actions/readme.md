## Basic Concepts and CI/CD Pipeline with Docker
<p>
Github Actions is a platform helping developer to automate workflows. Ususally workflow means a types of work that is time-consuming or tedius. For example, CI/CD is one of the supported functions(workflows) in Github Actions.
</p>

- CI : continuous integration => the process of integrating code into a mainline code base. In almost all scenarios today, CI is done using platforms designed specifically for the purpose.

<ul>

  - CD :  continuous delivery / continuous development
  <ul>
  - continuous delivery => automation coverage : development/local envivornment
  - continuous development => automation coverage : operation envivornment
  </ul>
</ul>

### Understanding workflows
Let's take a look at how a project is created and maintained in Github.

1. New repository is created
2. New contributors join
3. The contributors find issues and create pull requests
4. The issues and pull requests are reviewed
5. Merged to master branch 

<p>==== CI/CD ==== Comes in</p>

6. Write test codes towards the merged codes
7. Build the project and set the details(release notes, version number, etc)
8. Deploy the project
9. Return to 6 and start again. This is why CI/CD is needed to automate process 6 ~ 9.

Github Actions is created to automate some of the parts in above process as much as possible so that developer can focus on more important task. Then how the platform is able to automate such process? 

### How Github Actions automation is done
When somehting happens in the repository, whether by you or the third party, this unit is called event. 

- Pull request created/merged
- Contributors joined
- Issue created/closed

<p>And Github Actions 1) listens to the events 2) creates/triggers a corresponding execution. The most common workflow to automate in repository is CI/CD, which is demonstrated by below screenshot. 
</p>

<img src="../reference/ci-cd-process.png" width=697 height=296 alt="github workflow screenshot" />

<p>
Choosing Github Actions over other CI/CD tools has an advantage that it is easier to set up. You can just adopt the same tool(Github) for workflow automation rather than having to learn/install all the different platforms and tool combination. 
</p>

### Example with repository
1. Go to your github repository and click action tab. 
2. Choose workflow template based on your needs
3. The template will automatically create related configs in yaml format. 

<details>
    <summary>What is yaml?</summary>
YAML is a superset of JSON with indentation. It is more human-friendly and easier to understand than JSON thus commonly used to write configuration files.

</details>

4. The config yaml will be executed and managed in Github. Each job in a workflow runs in a fresh virtual environment.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:

  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.

```

5. Check action status in your repository action tab like below.

## GitHub Actions for development cycle automation
Topics covered by this tutorial are as follows : 

- Selecting OS/Node js version for github actions
- Test automation
- Approach to build artifact

- Node version changes and maintenance
<img src="../reference/node-version.png" alt="github action result screenshot" width=527 height=272 />

- matrix build(build several versions at the same time)
<img src="../reference/matrix-build.png" alt="github action result screenshot" width=412 height=288 />

```yml
name : My workflow

on : 
    push : 
        branches : [main]
    pull_reques : 
        branches : [main]

jobs : 
    build : # job 1 : build => host machine A
      runs-on : ubuntu-latest # virutal machine 
      strategy : 
          maxtrix : 
              os : [ubuntu-latest, window-2020]
              node-version : [12.x, 14.x] # two nodes will be built
      steps : 
        - uses : actions/checkout@v2 # copy your codes and paste to the virtual machine
        - name : npm install and build
        - run : | 
              npm install
              npm run build
    test : # job 2 : test => host machine B
      runs-on : ubuntu-latest
      strategy : 
          maxtrix : 
              os : [ubuntu-latest, window-2020]
              node-version : [12.x, 14.x]
      steps : 
        - uses : actions/checkout@v2
        - name : npm install and test
        - run : | 
              npm install
              npm test

```

### Understanding basic terms
The main terms of Github actions are as follows.

1. Workflows : Workflow consists of a few actions.
2. Job : a task to do
3. Step : a process to do the task
4. Action : copy your codes and paste to a virtual machine

### Tackle three issues
- managing main branch ====> setting a branch policy
- merging pull request at a proper timing ====> forcing pull request reviews
- managing issues and pull requests ====> labeling them with custom actions

#### Setting a branch policy
1. Go to your repository and click settings. 
2. Select Branches tab and click add rule in Branch protection rule. Check these rules 

- Require a pull request before merging ====> setting a number of reviewers
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Include administrators ====> even administarators should follow the branch policy 

<img src="../reference/branch-policy.png" alt="branch policy" width=1000 height=600 />

<img src="../reference/branch-policy-set1.png" alt="require pull request and status check" width=1000 height=600 />

<img src="../reference/branch-policy-set2.png" alt="include administrator" width=1000 height=600 />

You can check direct commit to main branch is blocked now.

#### Managing issues and pull requests
1. Go to Github marketplace to use customized actions created by users. 

2. Search and find what you feel like. In this tutorial, we will use 'Label approved pull requests'.
